The first step is to use room temperature butter. You can soften butter quickly by microwaving for 10 second intervals 2 or 3 times or you can set the butter out 1-2 hours before you begin. Use a mix of Sugars: brown sugar, and white sugar together. Brown sugar helps soften the cookies add more flavour and white sugar helps the cookies spread and adds sweetness.  For chewier and more flavorful cookies, use more brown sugar than white sugar. 

The next step is adding  eggs and Vanilla Extract: Eggs provide structure and richness, while vanilla adds flavor. You also need all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. A well mixed batter gives the cookies extra lift and leave them extra soft.

Adding Dry Ingredients to Wet Ingredients: Combine all the ingredients, then add the chocolate chips. Chill the Cookie Dough: For soft and chewy cookies, chill the cookie dough for 2 - 3 hours. This helps the cookies melt and cook evenly.

The next step is to set the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit. While your oven is heating up, use a Ice - Cream scooper to scoop you cookie dough on to the tray

The FINAL step is to take your cookies out of the oven, let them cool for 1 hour and enjoy with a tall glass of milk.
